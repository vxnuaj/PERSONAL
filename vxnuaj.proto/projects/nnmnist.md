As I got deeper into Brain Computer Interfaces, I realized that to build a solid foundation to work at the edge of the technology, I needed to gain a more technical understanding of the technology.

I immediately decided to get into deep learning, and this mini-project came to fruition. 

*A Neural Network to classify the MNIST dataset built in pure NumPy*

The rationale behind building a Neural Network in NumPy was to get a deeper understanding of the mathematics, architecture, and flow of a neural network.

Foundations are everything, to understand how something works, building it from first principles is a great way to do it.

Ultimately, the test accuracy reached up to 91% after training over 1000 Epochs with a .1 learning rate.
