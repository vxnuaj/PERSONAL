A Deep Learning Framework for sculpted for seamless implementation of lightweight models.

The motivation behind this project is to solidify my understanding of the architecture of Neural Networks and improve my technical skills as a programmer.

Functionality to use different activation / loss functions, regualization techniques, implemented SOTA models, and other advanced deep learning methodologies will be added to the library as I build up knowledge.

### Quickstart:

**PIP it!**

```
$ pip install nue
```

**Test out any of the following models!**

[Linear Regression](https://vxnuaj.github.io/nue/models.html#models-linreg)

[Logistic Regression](https://vxnuaj.github.io/nue/models.html#models-logreg)

[A Feedforward Neural Network for Classification](https://vxnuaj.github.io/nue/models.html#models-nn)

_See these **[examples](https://vxnuaj.github.io/nue/examples.html)** for sample usage_
