## NEOCORTEX

> _This is my personal [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault, which won't be entirely readable / coherent through GitHub._
> 
> _I'll release a published website of this vault soon (I think)._
### Structure
##### **Neurons** 

This folder holds all the "neurons" of this "neocortex".

It holds all the ideas, notes, and bits of curiosities for myself that I use as a reference to continue gaining depth into areas that I'm curious or interested in.
##### Astra

This folder holds my personal philosophy, thoughts, and ideas that apply to my life.
