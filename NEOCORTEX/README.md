# NEOCORTEX

> _This is my personal [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault, which won't be entirely readable / coherent through GitHub._
> 
> _I'll release a published website of this vault soon._
### Structure
##### **NEURONS** 
This folder holds all the "neurons" of this "neocortex". It holds all the ideas, notes, and bits of curiosities for myself that I use as a reference to continue gaining depth into areas that I'm curious or interested in.
##### FOR MYSELF
This folder holds my personal philosophy, thoughts, and ideas that apply to my life.

**Both are being (or will be) continuously updated.**
