The idea behind grid search is to define a set of values for all hyperparameters and evaluate all the possible combinations.

Perhaps we have a neural network and we want to tune $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

So, we define a set of values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and evaluate all the possible combinations.
