A [[computer vision]] task that predicts a class label to a set of input pixels using a deep learning algorithm ( typically in the form of [[Convolutional Neural Networks]]).

There are 3 types, [[Semantic segmentation]], [[Instance segmentation]], and [[Panoptic segmentation]].

They all assign labels to individual input pixels in the image, to mark different boundaries and shapes of different objects and regions in the image[^1].

[^1]: Typically, the deeper a convolutional neural network, the more complex objects, regions, features it will be able to capture leading to perhaps better accuracy, lest overfitting.
