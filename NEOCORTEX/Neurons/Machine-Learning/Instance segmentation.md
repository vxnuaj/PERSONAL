Instance segmentation aims to classify a set of pixels that make up an *instance* or a particular object within an image. 

It identifies and separates individual instances of objects within a class.

For example, instance segmentation would identify individual cars, pedestrians, and bicycles, as a whole rather than assigning individual pixels to labels of *cars, pedestrians, or bicycles* as is done in [[Semantic segmentation]]
