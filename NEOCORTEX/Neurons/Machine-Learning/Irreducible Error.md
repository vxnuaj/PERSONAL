In a model, $\hat{Y} = \hat{f}(X)$, if one were able to perfectly map $\hat{f}$ to $\hat{Y}$, as $f(X)$, there will still be some degree of error as the function to estimate $Y$ always includes some residual $\epsilon$. 

> $Y = f(X) + \epsilon$

This type of error is known as irreducible error, where it cannot be reduce through continuing to improve the accuracy of function $\hat{f}$ or $f$.

This comes about as a result of inherent variability in the $Y$, through $\epsilon$, not captured by the input variables $X$.

Factors include, immeasurable variation:

- The manufacturing of a drug given to a patient, the patient's general mental wellbeing, etc.
