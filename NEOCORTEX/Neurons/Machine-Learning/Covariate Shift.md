Covariate shift refers to the change in the distribution of the input data (features) between the training and testing phases of a machine learning model. 

In the context of deep models, covariate shift can also refer to the change in the distribution of the input features (or activations) among the layers of the model during training. 

This is called *Internal* Covariate Shift.

This shift among layers can occur as the model's parameters are updated, leading to changes in the distribution of activations within the network. 

Internal Covariate shift can negatively impact model performance, as the model may not generalize well to the new distributions encountered during testing. 

Techniques such as [[Batch Normalization]] can help mitigate the effects of internal covariate shift by normalizing the activations within each layer, stabilizing the distribution of inputs to each layer, thereby increasing the speed of learning as a byproduct.
