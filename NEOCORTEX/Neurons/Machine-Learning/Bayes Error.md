The error of the hypothetical and ideal [[Bayes Classifier]], which is analogous to the [[Irreducible Error]] in a [[Bayes Classifier]].

If a true [[Bayes Classifier]] were achieved, it's [[Bayes Error]] would be computed as:

$1 - max(P(Y = j | X = x_0))$

Essentially taking the maximum probability predicted over all classes and subtracting by $1$ to get the error.
