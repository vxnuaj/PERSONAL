#datastructure

An array is a data structure, formatted similarly to a list, but instead has to contain homogeneous elements, meaning they belong to the same data type, and are of fixed size that is predefined at the start.

Arrays, in computer memory are then stored in contiguous blocks of memory where each element of the array is stored in positions right next to each other in memory[^1]

[^1]: Which the position is denoted by it's [[Memory Address]]
