##### The Imitation Game

*Can Machines Think?*

To answer such a question, one needs a rigorous definition of the terms ***machine*** and ***think***.

But such definitions, if are based on common definition, are extremely ambiguous and if the answer is sought through a statistical poll, a reliable answer may not be found.

Instead (Alan), proposes the imitation game also known as the [[Turing Test]]

It is played with three people.

- A man
- A woman
- An interrogator

The interrogator ($C$) stays far apart, in a room in front of the other two.

The objective of the game is for the interrogator to determine who is a man ($A$) and who is a woman ($B$). 

At the beginning he knows them by $X$ and $Y$.

At the end he identifies either as man or woman.

If the interrogator ($C$) asks a question to $X$, which in this case say they are ($A$),

$A$ must respond in a way that attempts to prevent $C$ from getting the right answer.

On the other hand, $Y$ or in this instance, $B$, must attempt to help $C$ distinguish between the two.

> *Turing mentions the best thing would be for $B$ to tell the truth*

But their 'truth' is difficult to discern for $C$ as $A$ can spit the same lies.

Both must provide their answers in a means that gives no clue to who the person is (typewriting or another intermediary person.)

> *The difference then is consistency in response, no hallucination.*

Now the question lies in, ***What might happen if $A$ is replaced with a machine? Will $C$ decide as wrongly as often when the game is played as if it were only a man and a woman****

>*Here, Turing seems to imply that in the imitation game it is near impossible to differentiate from man or woman accurately and consistently with rational datapoints. It'd just be random guessing.
>
>For a machine to be intelligent, the imitation game must be played with a machine and have the same phenomena, the machine ($A$) being indistinguishable from $B$*

##### **Critique of the New Problem**

The means (question in answer with no physical presence) to distinguish machine from true intelligence clearly separates physical from intellectual activities. If it is only intelligence, then it must have no factor into physical abilities. 

Either $A$ or $B$ can boast about their intellectual activities but it wont matter if it seems to be true or not. The question and answer format disregards their importance. Only thoughts and ideas matter.

> *That's what makes humans & intelligence unique. They stem purely from the brain and they are creative processes. We're the only species that has a type of explanatory knowledge.*

During this imitation game, a machines "thought" processes may be very different from the thought processes of a human, but if a machine can play the imitation game and fool the interrogator satisfactorily, there is no need to regard of the underlying thought processes.

***This is all under the assumption that the best strategy of the machine is to try and provide the answers that would be given by a real human.***

> *But that's mimesis. Humans & intelligence aren't a byproduct of mimesis, they are a byproduct of understanding through creativity (disobedience) and error correction. If a computer is mimetic, it can't disobey and then it can't be creative and then it can't error-correct for itself to create it's own knowledge and intelligence through understanding. 
> 
> If a machines "thought processes" aren't able to understand the underlying concepts and are just mimetic, I don't believe that's intelligence.*

#### Digital Computers

The idea behind digital computers can be represented by the fact that they're intended to carry out any operations that can be done by a human.

Suppose a human is supposed to be following fixed rules, supplied by a book, altered when he is put to a new job.

He has an unlimited supply of paper to compute.

Now a digital computer has 3 parts:

1. A **store** of information (memory)
2. **Executive** **Unit**, carrying out the computations (computer chip) 
3. **Control** (To follow the instructions in the "book of rules", which is stored in the **store**)

A computer computers instructions are encoded in numerical form, that represent the different aspects of the operation to be carried out.

Each instruction is fit into a specific set of digits making a "packet" of information

> *It's all numbers*

The computer stores and executes instructions in order sequentially but a set of instructions can alter the flow of the order, akin to if statements and for loops.

This allows for computers to repeat operations until a condition is met

> _And logic_

This process can be scaled up to mimic the actions of a human very closely, to perform complex calculations and tasks that resemble human thought processes.[^1]

The *book of instructions* is fictional for a human as we remember what we have to do, but for a computer, they need this *book of instructions* to program the machine to do an operation.

> *Interesting, if all computation can be built on this type of foundational logic, including intelligence, creativity, etc, the case would then be that those mental qualities are purely physical and deterministic in a sense.*

A variant of this computer is a computer with a random element, where instructions involve a random number. This type of machine is commonly described as having "free will", given the seemingly randomness in human decision making. 

But it is typically difficult to distinguish one from the other as it can be produced with deterministic devices, such as making choices depend on digits of a decimal.

> *What if we're like this at the fundamental level but we don't know it. 
> What if our behavior is ultimately deterministic and our free will is an illusion? 
> 
> But then of course there may be emergent properties, there might be a type of radical locality within individual neurons and even on a lower level that give rise to different levels consciousness and intelligence at higher scales.*

The idea of a digital computer is very old and it need not rely on electricity (i.e., [Charles Babbage Analytical Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlbQsKpq3Ak)), the electricity is just a means for faster computation but a computer can be entirely constructed out of cards and wheels while still performing the same computation but of course at an extremely slow rate.

> *The thought experiment is about imagining a computer that has an infinite amount of time and an infinite amount of resources (paper). This type of computer can compute any operation that it is given and that exists per the laws of physics.[^1]*

Computers then may be classified as discrete. Then it seems that the initial state of the computer can be used to describe all possible future states, (i.e., Laplace's View), just as the complete state of the universe described by the fundamental particles can be used to predict all future states.

Then initial conditions matter most, where small changes, very small, on the order of fundamental particles can essentially change everything.

> *Interesting, seems more of a deterministic viewpoint*

Given the table (or book of instructions given to the discrete machine), it's possible that one could predict exactly what the computer will do over a period of time (given the prior deterministic viewpoint of computers).

Then there's no reason why prior prediction shouldn't be able to be computed by the means of a digital computer, given that the computer could quickly enough carry about the given behavior.

Then, during the imitation game [[turing test]], the interrogator wouldn't be able to distinguish from the digital computer nor discrete machine

"*This special property of digital computers, that they can mimic any discrete-state machine, is described by saying that they are universal machines*"

> *Or then more commonly, universal computers*

Thereby, the consequence of having machines with this property (disregarding speed), is that a single computer is able to compute any computable process that exists.

then

*"Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?"*

**Objections**

- Theological objections play to game, explanatory knowledge serves as a better explanation
- Consciousness required for intelligence.
	- Turing: Human's only appear to be conscious. Machines can too
	>*Mimesis isn't the way out....*
- Machines can't love, joke, create art, eat, etc
	- Turing: No reasoning behind this, just an opinion based on the world today and the lack that the world won't change
- The brain is analog (continuous)
		- A big enough computer can simulate it
- Deterministic rules mean predictable behavior, but humans don't seem as such
	- Humans could be a complex collection set of rules at the particle level

[^1]: As of course, that seems to be the only bounds to knowledge
