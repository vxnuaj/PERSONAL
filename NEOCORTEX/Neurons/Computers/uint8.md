#datatype

Standing for *unsigned 8-bit integer*, `uint8` is a type of data representation that can be used to represent digits within the range of $0 < digit < 2^8 -1$ or $0$ to $255$.

It's,

- **Unsigned** meaning that the value is non negative and can only be a positive integer or 0
- **8-bit** meaning that the value is stored in 8 binary digits (0s and 1s) to a maximum of $2^8 -1$. 

This type of data representation can be typically used to represent the pixel values of an image, as RGB, grayscale, or other formats.
