#logicgates

XOR is one of the fundamental [[logic gate]]s, that computes True (1) if only one of the inputs is True or False, and computes False if both of the inputs are either true or false.

The function table looks as such:

| Input 1 | Input 2 | XOR |
| ------- | ------- | --- |
| 0       | 0       | 0   |
| 0       | 1       | 1   |
| 1       | 0       | 1   |
| 1       | 1       | 0   |
