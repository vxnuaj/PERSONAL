A test proposed by Alan Turing on his paper, [[COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE]], where a human judge attempts to distinguish a computer from a human.

If the judge is fooled by the computer into thinking it is a human, it is intelligent.

Turing predicted that by the year 2000, machines with 100 MB of memory would be able to pass the test[^1]. 

[^1]: But of course, that prediction failed to become true.
