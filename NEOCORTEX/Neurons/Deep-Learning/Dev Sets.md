Development sets are an intermediary between training and testing sets. 

They serve a similar purpose to the test set, yet rather than being used as a final evaluation to the model, a model is tested in the development set and tuned based on the following results, empirically.

A development set is used to tune the model in order to introduce a type of variation to the model and prevent overfitting on the original training set.
