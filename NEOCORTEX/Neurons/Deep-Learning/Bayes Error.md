Bayes error is the lowest possible prediction error that can be achieved within a model.

There will always be a certain, even if small, amount of error in a model despite it knowing the probability distribution that generates the data, if the process that generates.

This is as there's always a small amount of noise or randomness within a probability distribution that makes it difficult to 

If for any reason the bayes error is high, i.e., 50%, a model won't be able to learn from a training set as the noise / randomness is extremely high that there is no pattern to discern.

To mitigate this, one might need to collect more data to increase the ability to gauge patterns and reduce randomness.
