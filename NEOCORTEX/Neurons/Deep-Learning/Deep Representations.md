Deep representations in a neural network are simply the internal representations that are learnt by a network as it processes data from a given image, audio sample, or other sample type.

In the example of an image, the first layer of a neural network, it typically learns to represent lower level and simpler features such as the edge, corners, textures, etc. 

In the latter layers of a network, by combining the representations of earlier layers, a model learns to represent higher level features such as shapes, objects, or specific scenes within an image. 

At this point is when the complexity of representations increases as the model learns more nuanced features of the input.
