The column picture is another way to visualize a system of linear equations, as a linear combination of a set of variables and coefficients (represented a column vectors).

$\begin{equation} x_1 \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} \\ a_{21} \end{pmatrix} + x_2 \begin{pmatrix} a_{12} \\ a_{22} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix} \end{equation}$

The goal, when solving via linear combination, is to figure out which combination of $x_1$ and $x_2$, or which combination of each vector, yields the vector $B$.

Graphically solving this system of linear equations involves taking a column vector, plotting it, then adding the the next column vector, in a manner that enables us to get the vector coordinates $B$ as a final destination.

In essence, the solution is found via vector addition.
