A limit within a function is essentially, a type of "wall".

A value, say $x$ that you can get closer and closer to but never fully reach.

You can get a number that gets closer and closer to $x$, but never the exact value because it doesn't exist.

Taking the function $f(x) = \frac{x - 4}{x-4}$, it's limit is present at $f(4)$ as plugging $4$ into $f(x)$, we get $\frac{0}{0}$, which does not exist.

Then the limit as $f(x) \rightarrow 4$ is equal to $1$.

For a limit to exist in it's two-sided form, the limit has to equal a same $y$ value as a function approaches as given $x$ from the right and left.

Essentially: $\lim_{x\rightarrow 4^-} =\lim_{x\rightarrow 4^+}$

If that doesn't hold to be true, then the $\lim_{x\rightarrow 4^-}$ will be defined differently to $\lim_{x\rightarrow 4^+}$ and then the general limit, $\lim_{x\rightarrow 4}$ does not exist.
