A metric to be defined as the harmonic mean between [[Precision]] and [[Recall]].

$F_1 = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} = \frac{2 \cdot TP}{2 \cdot TP + FP + FN}$

It answers how *good* and how *complete were the labels in question found?*

The goal when computing it is to maximize the [[Precision]] and [[Recall]].
