ℝ is defined as a set of all real numbers in a given space.

$n$ denotes the dimensionality of the space.

$ℝ^n$ then denotes the set of all real numbers in an $nth$ dimensional space.

## **Depth**

$ℝ^n$ can be then understood as $ℝ$ x $ℝ$ x $...$ x $ℝ$ (there being $n$ factors of $ℝ$)

Each $ℝ$ denotes all sets of possible real numbers, each set defining a coordinate of given points within that given space.

Then $ℝ$ x $ℝ$ is the cartesian product, their multiplication then representing all the sets of all real numbers, which can be seen as coordinate points, in the new space, in the case of $ℝ$ x $ℝ$, it being all real sets or coordinates, in a $2$ dimensional space.

This can be done for $n$-dimensions, to represent sets of all real numbers in the $nth$ dimension.
