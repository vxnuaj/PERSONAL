The row way is a means to visualize a system of linear equations, portraying each equation as a separate row.

$\begin{cases}a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 = b_1 \\a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 = b_2\end{cases}$

Each equation, depending on it's dimensionality, represents an $nth$-dimensional plane on a $nth$-dimensional plot.

When plotting this system of linear equations, the intersection between the equations represents the solution to it.
