A dot product is a multiplication between two vectors, 

$\begin{bmatrix}a_1 \\ a_2\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}x_1, x_2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}a_1x_1 + a_2x_2\end{bmatrix} = C$

where each element the of the first vector is multiplied correspondingly to the elements in the second vector and then summed.

The dot product then makes up a bigger [[Matrix Multiplication]]
