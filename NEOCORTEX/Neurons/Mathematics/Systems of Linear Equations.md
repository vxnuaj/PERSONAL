Systems of Linear Equations are a set of equations with $n$ unknowns.

The goal of these systems of equations are to compute these $n$ unknowns by solving each equation for each unknown.

A system of linear equations is traditionally defined as:

$2x - y = 0$
$-x + 2y = 3$

where it can be solved graphically as:

while it can also be defined through matrices as:

$\begin{bmatrix} 2, -1 \\ -1, 2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$

where this representation is a [[Matrix Multiplication]].

It can also be defined as a linear combination (column way, per Gilbert Strang), as:

$x\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} + y \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$

which can be solved graphically as:
