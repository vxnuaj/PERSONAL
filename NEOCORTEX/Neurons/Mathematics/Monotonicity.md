#functions 

A monotonic function is a function that is either entirely increasing or nondecreasing on it's domain within a given range. 

A monotonically increasing function is still considered as such if it's "increasing" stagnates but doesn't decrease. The same (though inversely) can be said about a monotonically decreasing function.

For example, [[ReLU]], defined as $max(0, z)$ is monotonically increasing over $x â‰¥ 0$ as it continues to increase for infinity. Despite it not increasing at the range x < 0, it is still considered monotonically increasing as it doesn't decrease.
