GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem states that in any formal mathematical system that is consistent (does not contain contradictions) and has sufficient complexity, there will exist statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system itself. This implies that there are inherent limitations to what can be proven or known in such systems.
