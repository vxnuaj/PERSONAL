The Manhattan Distance, also known as the L1 Norm, is the measure of length (magnitude) or distance of a vector relative to the origin in a *taxicab path or grid based system* within a euclidean space.

It's defined as $|| \vec{x}|| = \sum_n |x_n| = |x_1| + |x_2| + ... |x_n|$ 

Unlike the [[Euclidean Norm]], the Manhattan distance measures distance among a grid based system just how a taxicab navigates through New York.
