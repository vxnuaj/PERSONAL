Variance is a statistical measure that calculates the the average, of a set of values, squared difference from the mean.

To calculate this you:
1. Find the difference of each datapoint to the mean
2. Square each value
3. Find the average of all the values.

Essentially, it's the [[Standard Deviation]] squared.
