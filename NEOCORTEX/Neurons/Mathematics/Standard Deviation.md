The standard deviation is a statistical measure used to find the amount of variation of a set of values from the mean value.

A smaller standard deviation indicates that data points are close to the mean while a large standard deviation indicates that data points are spread out over a larger range.

It can be calculated by:
1. Finding the difference of each datapoint from the mean.
2. Averaging the differences over the total number of datapoints
