A non-singular matrix, $A$, is a square matrix where it's [[determinant]] is non-zero, thereby it is invertible as $A^{-1}$.

Thereby a non-singular matrix, in a linear system of equations $Ax = b$, has a unique solution for any existing vector $b$ that can be given by $x = A^{-1}+ b$, because $A^{-1}$ exists as $A$ is [[determinant]], and $A^{-1} A = I$ ([[Identity Matrix]]) is true.

Thereby a system of linear equations is easier to compute, as $x$ is simply equivalent to $x = A^{-1}b$.
