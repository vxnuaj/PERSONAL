## Hey :)

I opted out of UC Davis to fly across the country to Silicon Valley to learn
from exceptional founders and engineers.

Currently, I’m maximizing my skillsets within Deep Learning with the goal
to get to it’s bleeding edge within the year.

Recently, I’ve been obsessed with neural networks, knowledge creation &
epistemology, and paths to artificial superintelligence.

Also, I run (If you’re reading this, lemme know if you wanna go on a 15 mi. run. No one, besides 1, has been down for it so far!)

If you wanna chat, message me on Twitter or schedule a call!

Alternatively, if you want to stay updated with what I’ve been working on,
