## Hey :)

I'm Juan.

I like to tinker with technology.

I have this vision of pushing humanity forward by building scalable projects at the bleeding edge of technology and my curiosity.

I think if I learn how to build within my curiosities, I'll be able to generate [specific knoweldge](https://nav.al/specific-knowledge) to ultimately produce [great work](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html) for humanity.

These github repos serve as a training grounds for myself.

>_If you're navigating my github, you'll see most activity in my [Labs](../SINGULARITY/LABS), but will see more tangible projects as seperate repositories [here](https://github.com/vxnuaj?tab=repositories)_
