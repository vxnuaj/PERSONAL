I opted out of UC Davis and flew accross the country to spend the year in SF, to learn from high-agency engineers & founders.

Currently, I’m maximizing my skillsets within Deep Learning with the goal to get to it’s bleeding edge within the year.

Recently, I’ve been obsessed with machine intelligence, knowledge creation & epistemology, and paths to artificial superintelligence.

> _I'm shipping deep dives on these topics @ [my newsletter, infinity](https://vxnuaj.substack.com/s/infinity)!_

Also, I [run](https://strava.com/vxnuaj) (If you’re reading this, lemme know if you wanna go on a 15 mi. run. No one, besides 1, has been down for it so far!)

If you wanna chat, message me on [X](https://x.com/vxnuaj) or [schedule a call](https://cal.com/vxnuaj)!

Alternatively, if you want to stay updated with what I’ve been working on, check out my GitHub or subscribe to my Substack.
